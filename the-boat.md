# The Boat

A 10-meter autonomous sail- and solar-powered boat, designed to complete the first-ever unmanned circumnavigation of the globe.

## Basic Capabilities

- **Length:** 10 meters  
- **Primary propulsion:** Sail-powered  
- **Auxiliary propulsion:** Electric motor powered by solar energy  
- **Autonomy:** GPS-guided navigation with satellite telemetry and remote command  
- **Modular Design:** Built for repairability, upgrades, and extreme endurance  
- **Electronics:** ESP32-based controller and fully open-source navigation software  
- **Hull:** Designed in Onshape and built with accessible fabrication methods  
- **Estimated displacement:** ~100-150 kg fully loaded (exact final figure TBD)  

## Design Philosophy

- Open-source hardware and software  
- Designed in the open — every part visible and documented  
- Simplicity > complexity  
- Repairable at sea  
- Accessible to the maker community — no specialist shipyard required  
- Primary sail-powered, with auxiliary electric propulsion  
- Designed in Onshape — [View the public Onshape project link](#)
