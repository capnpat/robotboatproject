# The First Autonomous Unmanned Boat to Circumnavigate the Globe

**A 10-meter sail- and solar-powered robot boat. Open-source. Built by a global community.**

We are Patrick Coole and Alex Coole â€” two hobbyist makers launching a bold project to build the worldâ€™s first autonomous unmanned boat to sail around the world. The project is fully open-source, documented in public, and designed using accessible maker tools: Onshape, 3D printing, hobby CNC, off-the-shelf electronics.

**The goal:** To create an autonomous sailboat, with auxiliary solar-electric propulsion, capable of surviving and navigating a full circumnavigation of the globe â€” completely unmanned.

We invite anyone to join â€” contribute ideas, expertise, or support â€” and help push the boundaries of autonomous maritime exploration.
